## Step 2 : Installing NGINX as an Ingress Controller

So that's **really** simple! The [NGINX Installation guide on K8S](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) provides all the instructions (insanely easy). 

In this case, even if we installing K8S on Google Cloud Platform, we're **not using GKE**, so **DO NOT** install NGINX using [the GCE-GKE installation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke), since that will actually try to provision a Google Cloud Load Balancer, which I want to avoid here.

The reason I want to avoid this Load Balancer is that even in its simplest configuration, it ends up being **pretty expensive** (around 18$ a month), which is unnecessary for simple workloads.

So to install NGINX as an Ingress Controller, follow the [Bare Metal installation instructions](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#bare-metal), which will actually install the Ingress Controller as a `NodePort` instead of a `LoadBalancer`. 

To do that simply `kubectl` the following: 

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/deploy.yaml
```

Et voil√†! <br>
